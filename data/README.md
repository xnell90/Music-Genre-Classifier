# Data Collection

All music files will be organized in the genres folder. Each file is stored as
a 10 second .wave file, and it will fall into one of five categories:
	* Classical
	* Hip Hop
	* Jazz
	* Pop
	* Rock

The dataset will come from multiple sources, including:
	1. My Personal Music Collection
	2. Audio Set
	3. Free Music Archive

For the python code that was used to extract the data, see the scripts folder
(coming soon...).
