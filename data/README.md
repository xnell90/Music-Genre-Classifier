# Music Data

All music files will be organized in the genres folder, and they can be downloaded from the following link (Coming Soon). Each file is stored as a 10 second .wave file, and it will fall into one of five categories:

* Soundtrack
* Hip Hop
* Jazz
* Pop
* Rock

The dataset will come from multiple sources including:

1. My Personal Music Collection
2. Audio Set (Work In Progress)
3. Free Music Archive

To learn more about how the data was extracted from these sources, feel free to browse into the '_scripts' folders and read the README.md file.
