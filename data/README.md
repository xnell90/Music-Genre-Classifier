# Data Collection

All music files will be organized in the genres folder. Each file is stored as
a 10 second .wave file, and it will fall into one of five categories:

* Soundtrack
* Hip Hop
* Jazz
* Pop
* Rock

The dataset will come from multiple sources including:

1. My Personal Music Collection (Complete)
2. Audio Set (In Progress)
3. Free Music Archive (In Progress)

For the python code that was used to extract the data, see the scripts folder
As of now, all scripts relating to my personal music collection are  in the
scripts folders.
