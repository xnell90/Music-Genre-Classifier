# Data Collection

All music files will be organized in the genres folder. Each file is stored as a 10 second .wave file, and it will fall into one of five categories:

* Soundtrack
* Hip Hop
* Jazz
* Pop
* Rock

The dataset will come from multiple sources including:

1. My Personal Music Collection (Completed)
2. Audio Set (In Progress)
3. Free Music Archive (Completed except README)

For the python code that was used to extract the data, see all folders that end with '_scripts'.
