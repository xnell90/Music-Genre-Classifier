# Music Data

All music files will be organized in the genres folder, and they can be downloaded from the link below. Each file is stored as a 10 second .wave file, and it will fall into one of five categories:

* Soundtrack
* Hip Hop
* Jazz
* Pop
* Rock

The dataset will come from multiple sources including:

1. My Personal Music Collection
2. Youtube Playlists
3. Free Music Archive

To learn more about how the data was extracted from these sources, feel free to browse into the '_scripts' folders and read the README.md file. For the exploratory data analysis, feel free to look over the **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb** notebook. If you want to clone this repository, I recommend that you download the dataset from the link below, extract the zip file to get the **genres** folder, and store it under the **data** folder.
