# YouTube Audio

There are two python script files that you can run to extract audio from youtube videos, more specifically from youtube playlists.

 * *extract_youtube_playlist.py*
 * *load_youtube_playlist.py*

The *extract_youtube_playlist.py* allows you to download all videos from a playlist url to a folder that is labeled as the playlist name. Once downloaded, you can run *load_youtube_playlist.py* script to load the .wav files provided that you entered the **name of playlist folder**, and the **genre** of the playlist.
