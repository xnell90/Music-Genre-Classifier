    "After exploring and analyzing the music dataset, we hypothesized that the best model that can classify a song's or music track's genre will be the convolutional neural network. To justify why it might be the best choice for our supervised learning problem, let's take a look at an example mel-spectrogram.\n",

    "As you can see in this image,\n",
    "* There are multiple squiggly lines at the lower segment of the image so it indicates that there is a vocalist in the music track.\n",
    "* There are many bright vertical lines that is consistently spaced so it means that the music track has a consistent beat.\n",

    "If the mel-spectrogram was shifted slightly to the left by one pixel, then intuitively, it looks like the same mel-spectrogram. Hence, if the shifted mel-spectrogram was translated to an audio file, then it would sound the same as the original. This means that if we need a model that can identify a track's genre, then it must be translationally invariant. Fortunately, the convolutional neural network model is designed to be translationally invariant because it inherently uses a filter that passes through an image to perform a convolutional operation. Fore more details about CNNs, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network.\n",

    "Before we can use CNNs to classify a song's genre, we first need to preprocess our music dataset so that it can be easily used as input for our model."
