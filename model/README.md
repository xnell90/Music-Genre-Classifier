# Model Development

To extract the Convolutional Neural Network models that were explored in the notebook, simply run it. However, before running it in your local repository, you must have the music files from the google link that is stored under the **data/genres** folder before you can run the notebook. By the time it is completed, you will have the following files:

Numpy Dataset:
 * melspectrograms.npy
 * extracted_features.npy
 * one_hot_encoded_genres.npy

CNN Models:
 * cnn_model.hdf5
 * pretrained_cnn_model_v1.hdf5
 * pretrained_cnn_model_v2.hdf5
 * modified_pretrained_cnn_model.hdf5

 Alternatively, you can download the zip file **output_files.zip** from the link below, unzip it, and move each file in the output_files folder to this directory.
