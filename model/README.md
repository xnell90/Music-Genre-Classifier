# Model Development

To extract the Convolutional Neural Network models that were explored in the notebook (**model_development.ipynb**), simply run it. However, before running it in your local repository, you must have the music files from the google link that is stored under the **data/genres** folder. By the time it is completed, you will have the following files:

Numpy Dataset:
 * melspectrograms.npy
 * extracted_features.npy
 * one_hot_encoded_genres.npy

CNN Models:
 * cnn_model.hdf5
 * pretrained_cnn_model_v1.hdf5
 * pretrained_cnn_model_v2.hdf5
 * modified_pretrained_cnn_model.hdf5

Alternatively, you can download the zip file **output_files.zip** from the first link below, unzip it, and move each file in the output_files folder to this directory. These files (**model_architecture.json** and **model_weights.h5**) correspond to the best model for music genre classification (**modified_pretrained_cnn_model.hdf5**), and they were generated by the commented code in **utils.py**. They will be used in the web application.
