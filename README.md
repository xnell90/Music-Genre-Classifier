# Music Genre Classifier

This repository demonstrates how you can create a CNN to classify a song's genre, and deploy the model into a Heroku web application.

There are three branches associated to this repository:
 * master
 * streamlit-app-v1.0
 * command-line-interface-v1.0

The master branch contains documentation on how the convolutional neural network model was created using Keras with Tensorflow as a backend framework. It also includes python code on how the music data was collected and formatted prior to the training process of the neural network.

The streamlit branch contains the necessary code to deploy the web application into Heroku, and includes instruction how to deploy the web application to Heroku.

Finally, the command-line branch contains the minimal amount of code for running the app via the terminal.

 Note: master and streamlit branch can be run the streamlit app locally. Simply run the command *streamlit run app.py*.
